High-priority
- Build an automated testing scheme for the Jersuite
- Audit the undotree group type for performance improvements
- Move undotree group type to its own plugin

Easy
- Look at every tpope plugin and decide which ones I want
- Allow specifying extra plugins in .vimrc
- Persistent undo
- Add command that accepts range of lines and executes them as vimscript
- Lookup shiftwidth and tabstop in a table of some kind. Make sure their values are applicable recursively to directories
- Make a colour scheme without big white bars

Hard but I know how
- Command that populates location/quickfix list from backtraces
- Split :Flash into its own plugin
- Split :Tops into its own plugin
- Pre-8.0 version compatibility
- Replace common big motions like H M L Ctrl-D and Ctrl-U with more animated versions
- Add mapping to change instances of "false" to "true" and vice versa
- Write that plugin that lets you scroll inside indented blocks while keeping the outside of the blocks at the top and bottom of the window

I don't know how
- Figure out Tags
- Figure out some convenient way to store sessions
- Write a command that calls my company's compiler and puts errors in the quickfix list
- Populate the pmenu with only tokens from the current indented block
- Add a new subwin on the right that shows marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a new subwin on the right that shows the jump list
- Add a new uberwin on the left that shows global marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a way to choose which window to use as the destination for quickfix window jumps based on available location lists
- See if there's a way to draw columns to the left of indented blocks
- Write a custom foldtext
- Figure out a way to highlight matching angle brackets - tricky because the characters < and > aren't always used as angle brackets
- Write a plugin that persists the the location lists outside the session, and restores them after this happens
- Write a plugin that persists the the quickfix list outside the session, and restores it after this happens
- Investigate whether the undotree can be persisted outside the session and restored after this happens
- Come up with a plan for vim9script adoption in jersuite - may not be worth the headache
