Easy
- Install vim-surround

Hard but I know how

- Split :Flash into its own plugin
- Split :Tops into its own plugin
- Put the line number refreshing into a cursorhold callback to avoid churn

I don't know how
- Figure out why terminal windows keep spontaneously changing statuslines

I don't know if I know how
- Add an undotree visualization plugin
- Automatically jump to location/quickfix window after commands that change its content
