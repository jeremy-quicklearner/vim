Easy
- Look at every tpope plugin and decide which ones I want
- Allow specifying extra plugins in .vimrc
- Persistent undo
- Add l: to all variables in functions
- Add command that accepts range of lines and executes them as vimscript
- Lookup shiftwidth and tabstop in a table of some kind. Make sure their values are applicable recursively to directories

Hard but I know how
- Command that populates location/quickfix list from backtraces
- Split :Flash into its own plugin
- Split :Tops into its own plugin
- Put the line number refreshing into a cursorhold callback to avoid churn
- Pre-8.1 version compatibility
- Replace common big motions like H M L Ctrl-D and Ctrl-U with more animated versions
- Add mapping to change instances of "false" to "true" and vice versa
- Add a new subwin on the left that shows marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a new uberwin on the left that shows global marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a way to choose which window to use as the destination for quickfix window jumps based on available location lists

I don't know how
- Figure out why terminal windows keep spontaneously changing statuslines
- Figure out why location windows' statuslines glitch out sometimes
- Figure out Tags
- Add a way to switch off line wrapping per window
- Figure out some convenient way to store sessions
- Write a command that calls a ws make and puts errors in the quickfix list

I don't know if I know how
- Add an undotree visualization plugin
- Automatically jump to location/quickfix window after commands that change its content
- Subwin/Uberwin engine
- Make locwins into subwins
- Make qfwins into uberwins
- Make Help into uberwin
