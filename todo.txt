Easy
- Install vim-surround

Hard but I know how
- Command that populates location/quickfix list from backtraces
- Fix the problem with signs 

I don't know how
- Figure out why terminal windows keep spontaneously changing statuslines
- Figure out some way to set formatting options dynamically, maybe based on file path

I don't know if I know how
- Add an undotree visualization plugin
- Automatically jump to location/quickfix window after commands that change its content
- Automatically resize the location list after jumping to it if it is too small
