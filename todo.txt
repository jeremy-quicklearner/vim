Easy
- Look at every tpope plugin and decide which ones I want
- Allow specifying extra plugins in .vimrc
- Persistent undo
- Add l: to all variables in functions
- Add command that accepts range of lines and executes them as vimscript
- Lookup shiftwidth and tabstop in a table of some kind. Make sure their values are applicable recursively to directories
- Make a colour scheme without big white bars

Hard but I know how
- Command that populates location/quickfix list from backtraces
- Split :Flash into its own plugin
- Split :Tops into its own plugin
- Put the line number refreshing into a cursorhold callback to avoid churn
- Pre-8.1 version compatibility
- Replace common big motions like H M L Ctrl-D and Ctrl-U with more animated versions
- Add mapping to change instances of "false" to "true" and vice versa

I don't know how
- Figure out why terminal windows keep spontaneously changing statuslines
- Figure out Tags
- Add a way to switch off line wrapping per window
- Figure out some convenient way to store sessions
- Write a command that calls a ws make and puts errors in the quickfix list
- Populate the pmenu with only tokens from the current indented block
- Add a new subwin on the right that shows marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a new uberwin on the left that shows global marks. Jump to each mark with <enter> and <space>
- Add a way to choose which window to use as the destination for quickfix window jumps based on available location lists
- See if there's a way to draw columns to the left of indented blocks
